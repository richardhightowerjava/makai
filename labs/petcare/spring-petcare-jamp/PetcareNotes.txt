PetCare Notes

This is what I had to do to get pet care running on Resin server and adapt it to this project.


* Dependency modifications to satisfy EL classes
	pom.xml
	<!-- Don't force tomcat 6 dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
            <artifactId>jasper-el</artifactId>
            <version>6.0.13</version>
        </dependency>
		
		
* Fix petcare home page issues (expecting "scripts" attribute)

* Hacked out spring security

* Did "push in" refactor of ROO content

TODO * Created JAMP services for existing controller entities.
TODO * Got unit tests functional with JAMP entities
TODO * Modified front end to work with JAMP for backend communication
