Callbacks get registered over every refresh. Need to somehow reconnect the client.
Perhaps it is possible to use something to identify? Cookie?  Otherwise the
queue of callbacks will fill up with zombies.
...or maybe not since we only show one actual beign sent even though collection has 3.

I'm not sure messaging (rq/rs) errors are being handled as errors, they come in with "error" but over the onMessage method.
